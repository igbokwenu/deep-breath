    "In loving memory of my mum, Kathrine Ugochi Okafor, the most prayerful woman who ever lived, and Colleen Holloran Foshee of Deep Breath Ministries, a remarkable woman of faith. Special thanks to Lisa Ramsey, whose constant fellowship with me rebuilt my faith through my health challenges; And to Tochukwu Nnamonu (TC), a friend and brother who would not let things I built over the years collapse. Special thanks to Alan and Holly Smith who provided a myraid of scriptural references and faith building resources which ended up inspiring my making of this app. And to my siblings; Dee, Nnanyelu, Amaka and Sweet for their support and prayers. And to Judie, and Jack for the fellowship. \n This app was originally intended as a personal resource for building my faith in the midst of a health crises that eventually spiraled into a health and financial crisis. Over the course of time, I realised that my crisis was a spiritual first affair as the doctors could not find anything wrong with me physically. This triggered a spiritual reawakening and a journey that has brought me here. It is my hope and prayers that you find these resources helpful in whichever aspect of your life that you seek healing.";
